## Version
Python: 3.8.10


## Runtime
Each iteration over the full corpus took ~40s, and a full run of 500 iterations lasted about 5.5hr

## Notes:
I left the development code in at the bottom to facilitate future testing, though I did end up tweaking the final code,
so I'm not sure if the development code still runs. Should be enough to change the 'iterations' variable and run it on the full set though.


Thanks for all your work this semester,
and remember to have yourself a damn fine day!
